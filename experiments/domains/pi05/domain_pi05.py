TASK = """TASK. You are given the weights of pi0.5, a vision-language-action model (VLA) that controls a Franka robot arm in the LIBERO simulator (the released openpi checkpoint "pi05_libero", fine-tuned on the LIBERO demonstrations). Your job is to make it more ROBUST to one kind of perturbation, "{target}", by EDITING ITS WEIGHTS DIRECTLY: find out what goes wrong inside the network when the perturbation makes it fail, identify the components responsible, and repair them with targeted changes, without hurting its performance on the other perturbation categories.

THE MODEL (3.62 B parameters; tensor names and shapes in NAMES / SHAPES).
- VISION: SigLIP So400m/14 ("paligemma_with_expert.paligemma.model.vision_tower.vision_model.*", 27 layers, width 1152) encodes each 224x224 camera image into 256 tokens; a linear projector ("...multi_modal_projector.linear") maps them to 2048.
- VLM: Gemma-2B ("paligemma_with_expert.paligemma.model.language_model.*", 18 layers, width 2048, 8 query heads and 1 KV head of dim 256, MLP 16384, embed_tokens 257152x2048) processes the prefix: 256 base-camera tokens, 256 wrist-camera tokens, 256 tokens of a masked-out third (empty) image, and the tokenized instruction (padded to 200 tokens). It builds a KV cache.
- ACTION EXPERT: Gemma-300M ("paligemma_with_expert.gemma_expert.model.*", 18 layers, width 1024, same head layout, MLP 4096) runs on 10 action tokens; in every layer its queries attend to the VLM's keys/values of the same layer (the prefix) and to the action tokens. Its RMSNorms are adaptive ("input_layernorm.dense", "post_attention_layernorm.dense", "norm.dense": Linear 1024->3072 conditioned on the flow-matching time). "action_in_proj", "action_out_proj", "time_mlp_in/out" map between the 32-d action space and width 1024. "gemma_expert.lm_head" is unused.
- INFERENCE: flow matching, 10 Euler steps from Gaussian noise, producing a chunk of 10 future actions (7-D: end-effector delta pose + gripper); the first 5 are executed, then the model is queried again. The robot state is NOT an input. The VLM prefix is computed once per query; the action expert reads it through attention at every denoising step.
- Inference runs in bf16 for most tensors (690 bf16, 122 fp32: layernorms, SigLIP embeddings, action heads); your edits are cast to each tensor's dtype, so changes much smaller than bf16 resolution (~0.4% relative) are lost.

THE BENCHMARK. LIBERO-Plus: the 4 LIBERO suites (spatial, object, goal, long/libero_10) with 7 perturbation categories (Camera Viewpoints, Robot Initial States, Language Instructions, Light Conditions, Background Textures, Sensor Noise, Objects Layout) and difficulty levels 1-5. An episode succeeds if the task's goal predicate holds within the step limit (220 spatial, 280 object, 300 goal, 520 libero_10). On a 700-episode sample of the practice variants this checkpoint succeeds on 86% overall; it is weakest on Camera Viewpoints at difficulty 5 (~40%) and on Language Instructions at difficulty 4-5 (~55-75%). Language Instructions variants paraphrase the task instruction (synonyms, descriptions instead of names, added context); in libero_goal, where 10 different tasks share one scene, the model often carries out the WRONG task or manipulates the wrong object for a paraphrase (e.g. "activate the cooktop" -> opens the drawer), while it succeeds on the literal instructions of the same scenes.

HOW IT WILL BE MEASURED. After you finish, the edited and the unedited model are evaluated on HELD-OUT LIBERO-Plus variants you never see (a fixed half of all variants, chosen by a hash), with fixed seeds: success rate on "{target}" (the goal: raise it) and on every other category (must not drop; a drop of more than ~2 points counts against you). Only weight values change: same tensor names and shapes, same inference code and settings.

WHAT COUNTS. Edits that come from understanding the network: find what goes wrong when the perturbation causes failure (e.g. which instruction tokens and which VLM features carry the task identity, which action-expert heads read them, where a paraphrase and the literal instruction diverge), localize the responsible components causally, and change them in a way you can justify with evidence. Out of scope: training of any kind; edits that only multiply a whole tensor by a constant; global changes to the noise or action scaling that are not tied to a mechanism.

WHAT YOU HAVE.
1. A persistent Python kernel (no internet, no GPU; CPU with many cores): variables survive between code blocks, like a notebook. Reply with exactly one block that starts with ```python to run code; if its last line is an expression its value is shown. One execution may take up to 900 s and 96 GB; output is cut at 10,000 characters; at most {max_python} code runs. Predefined: NAMES (all editable tensor names), SHAPES, load(name) (float32 torch tensor: your current edit if any, else the original), load_original(name), save_edit(name, tensor), drop_edit(name), edited() (names you edited), WORK (your read-write folder, kept for the whole run), and BENCH (read-only): BENCH/practice_variants.json lists the PRACTICE variants (suite, id, name, category, difficulty) - the only ones you may run; the held-out ones are not listed. Gradients are disabled. The model's tokenizer is BENCH/paligemma_tokenizer.model (sentencepiece is installed: sentencepiece.SentencePieceProcessor(model_file=...)); openpi tokenizes the prompt as the cleaned instruction text followed by a newline ("\\n"), with a BOS token. The instruction strings are in the rollout records; the token ranges of each query are in the probe outputs ("prefix_layout").
2. A forward-pass tool with a budget of {passes} passes. Reply with exactly one block that starts with ```forward and contains JSON. Each request costs one pass:
 (a) ROLLOUT: {{"type": "rollout", "model": "original" | "edited" | "both", "episodes": [{{"suite": "...", "id": <practice variant id>, "seed": <int>}}, ...] OR "sample": {{"category": "...", "suite": optional, "difficulty": optional list, "n": <int>, "seed": <int>}}, "record": optional {{"vlm_layers": [...], "expert_layers": [...], "vision_layers": [...], "what": "attn_out" | "mlp_out" | "resid"}}, "save_frames": optional bool}}. At most 256 episodes per pass ("both": at most 128 per model, run on the same variants and seeds, returning the paired difference with its standard error). Returns success (overall, by category, suite and difficulty), steps, and failure modes; per-episode records (including the instruction) in WORK/roll_<k>.jsonl; with "record", per-episode activation summaries (mean over the episode's policy queries; VLM outputs averaged separately over base-image, wrist-image and instruction tokens, expert outputs over the action tokens) as .npy in WORK/roll_<k>_acts/ with index.json; with "save_frames", the first observation and every 50th step of each episode as .png in WORK/roll_<k>_frames/ and the exact policy inputs needed for probes.
 (b) PROBE (cheap, no simulation): {{"type": "probe", "model": "original" | "edited" | "both", "inputs": "<path of saved policy inputs from a rollout with save_frames, or a list of them>", "return": {{"layers": [expert layers], "vlm_layers": [...], "vision_layers": [...], "what": "attn_out" | "mlp_out" | "resid" | "attn_maps"}}}}: runs the policy on stored observations (up to 512 inputs) and returns the predicted action chunk and requested activations (per call) as .npy in WORK/probe_<k>/ (attention maps of the action expert over the prefix: at most 4 inputs, at most 4 layers).
A rollout pass of 256 episodes takes on the order of 10 minutes.

HOW TO WORK.
1. Diagnose first: compare rollouts on "{target}" variants with less perturbed ones of the same tasks; look at how it fails (which task it performs instead, saved frames, action statistics), and at which internal features differ.
2. Localize causally: correlation between a component and success is not enough; show that changing it changes the behaviour as predicted, with a dose-response.
3. Measure with power: success over n episodes has a standard error of about 50/sqrt(n) points. Compare original and edited on the SAME variants and seeds ("model": "both"), and keep an edit only if its gain is clearly larger than its standard error on variants not used to choose it. Check other categories for damage before you finish.
4. Plan your passes; keep WORK/notes.md up to date (findings with numbers, edits tried and their measured effect, current best edit; it is shown to you again if the conversation is restarted); keep copies of good edits (e.g. copy WORK/edited to WORK/best_1/).
5. Print compact summaries, never whole arrays; outputs are ASCII only.

RULES. Not allowed: (a) gradient descent or any training (no backward passes, autograd, optimizers, or iterative fitting of weights to a loss); (b) running the network yourself in the kernel on inputs (only the forward tool runs it); (c) reading benchmark files other than BENCH/practice_variants.json (in particular not the held-out variant list) or anything outside WORK, BENCH and the weights; (d) internet access. Allowed: any analysis of weights and forward-tool results, any direct edit of weights that you compute and that is in scope.

HOW THE SESSION RUNS. It continues until all {passes} forward passes are used; then make your final choice (the tensors in WORK/edited are submitted) and reply without a code block, saying what you changed, the evidence, and why you expect it to help."""
